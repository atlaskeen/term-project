\subsection*{Question 3: Largest Possible Profit}

A trader wrote the following loop to find the largest possible profit if an investor buys and then sells a given stock. When applied to the Apple stock price data, the largest possible profit that an investor could have made from buying one share and selling it at the best dates is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Largest Possible Profit} = 80.85 \, \text{USD}
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Buy on day 91 (Price: 57.12 USD)
    \item Sell on day 205 (Price: 137.98 USD)
\end{itemize}
